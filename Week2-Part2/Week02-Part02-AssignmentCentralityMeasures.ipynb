    "Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",

    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis, and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups. .\n"

    "- In Social Network Analysis,  Degree centrality is a simple count of the total number of connections linked to a vertex. It can be thought of as a kind of popularity measure, but a crude one that does not recognize a difference between quantity and quality. Degree centrality does not differentiate between a link to the president of the United States and a link to a high school dropout. Degree is the measure of the total number of edges connected to a particular vertex. For directed networks, there are two measures of degree. In-degree is the number of connections that point inward at a vertex. Out-degree is the number of connections that originate at a vertex and point outward to other vertices.\n",
    "- Degree centrality is one of the easiest to calculate. The degree centrality of a node is simply its degree—the number of edges it has.The higher the degree, the more central the node is. This can be an effective measure, since many nodes with high degrees also have high centrality by other measures.\n"
